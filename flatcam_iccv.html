		<h3><b>Abstract</b></h3>
		<p>Recent advancements in fields like Internet of Things(IoT), augmented reality, etc. have led to an unprecedented demand for miniature cameras with low cost that can be integrated anywhere and can be used for distributed monitoring. Mask-based lensless imaging systems make such inexpensive and compact models realizable. However, reduction in the size and cost of these imagers comes at the expense of their image quality due to the high degree of multiplexing inherent in their design. In this paper, we present a method to obtain image reconstructions from mask-based lensless measurements that are more photorealistic than those currently available in the literature. We particularly focus on FlatCam, a lensless imager consisting of a coded mask
placed over a bare CMOS sensor. Existing techniques for reconstructing FlatCam measurements suffer from several drawbacks including lower resolution and dynamic range than lens-based cameras. Our approach overcomes these drawbacks using a fully trainable non-iterative deep learning based model. Our approach is based on two stages: an inversion stage that maps the measurement into the space of intermediate reconstruction and a perceptual enhancement
stage that improves this intermediate reconstruction based on perceptual and signal distortion metrics. Our proposed method is fast and produces photo-realistic reconstruction as demonstrated on many real and challenging scenes.</p>
